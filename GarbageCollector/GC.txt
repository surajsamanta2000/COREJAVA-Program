📝 Notes:


==>System.gc() is just a request to the JVM — it may or may not run the GC immediately.

==>finalize() is deprecated since Java 9 and removed in Java 18+ — best avoided in production code.

==>Modern Java uses other tools like PhantomReference, WeakReference, and profilers for memory management
